stack programming problems:
• reverse letters in a string, reverse words in a line, or reverse 
a list of numbers
• find out whether a string is a palindrome
• examine a file to see if its braces { } and other operators 
match
• convert infix expressions to postfix or prefix

STACK APPLICATION 
• Describe, how to add 592 and 3784 using 
Stacks

STACK APPLICATIONS 
• Write a pseudo code Algorithm to convert 
Decimal to Binary using a Stack

Converting Decimal to Binary: Consider the following pseudo code 
1) Read (number)
2) Loop (number > 0)
1) digit = number modulo 2
2) print (digit)
3) number = number / 2
The problem with this code is that it will print the binary
number backwards. (ex: 19 becomes 11001instead of 10011. )
To remedy this problem, instead of printing the digit right away, 
we can push it onto the stack. Then after the number is done 
being converted, we pop the digit out of the stack and print it.

Finding Palindromes
• Problem: Write a program that reads a string 
and determines whether it is a palindrome

Balanced Parentheses
• When analyzing arithmetic expressions, it is 
important to determine whether an expression is 
balanced with respect to parentheses
( a + b * ( c / ( d – e ) ) ) + ( d / e )
• The problem is further complicated if braces or 
brackets are used in conjunction with 
parentheses
• The solution is to use stacks!

• Basic Algorithm
1. Make an empty stack
2. Read symbols until the end of the file
a) If symbol is opening symbol, push it 
into the stack
b) If it is closing symbol and if the stack 
is empty, then report an error.
c Otherwise, pop the stack, if the symbol 
popped is not in the corresponding 
opening symbol , then report an 
error
3. At the end of the file, if the stack is not 
empty, report an error.
Note : we should not consider a parenthesis 
as a symbol if it occurs inside a comment, 
string, constant or character string.


Evaluating a postfix expression
• Initialise an empty stack
• While token remain in the input stream
–Read next token
–If token is a number, push it into the stack
–Else, if token is an operator, pop top two tokens 
off the stack,apply the operator, and push the 
answer back into the stack
• Pop the answer off the stack.
